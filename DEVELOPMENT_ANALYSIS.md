- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (built-in, cross-platform)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for game state
- **Algorithm**: Backtracking for solving

## 🚨 Identified Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issues
1. **Documentation Mismatch**: README describes "terminal-based" tool, but main implementation is GUI-only
2. **Incomplete Validation Logic**: `is_board_valid()` method has placeholder comment (line 116)
3. **Limited Puzzle Database**: Only 1 puzzle per difficulty level severely limits replay value

### Code Quality Issues
1. **No Testing Infrastructure**: Zero test coverage
2. **Missing Documentation**: No docstrings or inline comments
3. **No Error Logging**: Basic error handling without logging system
4. **Hardcoded Values**: Magic numbers and strings throughout codebase

### Feature Gaps
1. **No Terminal Interface**: Despite README mention
2. **No Game Statistics**: No tracking of solve times, attempts, etc.
3. **No Difficulty Scaling**: Fixed difficulty levels without progression
4. **No User Preferences**: No settings or customization options

### Performance Concerns
1. **GUI Responsiveness**: Solver might freeze GUI during complex puzzles
2. **Memory Usage**: No optimization for large puzzle databases
3. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Basic backtracking without optimization
